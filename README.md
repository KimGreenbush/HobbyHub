# HobbyHub

A C# exam project, completed and deployed, for [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/).

I had 5 hours to complete all the features before deployment on AWS\(currently inactive\).

I was allowed to have some initial setup completed beforehand.

A website for users to add and share hobbies that others can add to or remove from their hobby list.

Hobbies must have a unique name and the creator of a hobby is the only one who can delete it.
